# Finances

It's personal finances tracker and analyzer. It perfectly fits for my own usage patterns. 

Under the hood, this project uses `Caliburn.Micro` framework and `Unity` as carcass constructions. `MahApps.Metro` toolkit and `ModernUICharts` library are there for visual appearance and charts building.

### Features:
- Tracking expenses, incomes, shared spending, debts.
- Build statistics such as spending by day, by category for month and year, expense to outcome comparison.
- Funds dashboard that shows all fund sources (cash, credit card, debts) together.
- Calculate divergence between real and estimated balance after each operation
- Pulls credit card balance and last transactions (work in progress) through online banking API.
- Builds visual prediction by each day about future money balance based on permanent operations (rent, food, deposits, sport, utility bills).
